### **About the Project**

This project is for teams of 1-2 (we would prefer teams of 2), every team must have at least 1 programmer. The project is split into 3 parts. Every team must do the Editor and Programming parts, you only have to do the Art part if you have an artist in your group. 

### **Grade Breakdown:**

Requirements: 55%

Complexity: 25%

Creativity: 20%

_These two categories are here for your benefit. We want to allow students to have fun with these projects, do not stress over these categories._

The requirements are listed below, some are left vague and open-ended. These open-ended requirements are where you can earn your creativity and complexity points.

### **Unity Editor (Artists and/or Programmers):**

* Oh No! Mario appears to be stuck in the ground and he keeps falling through the floor. Figure out how to manipulate Marioâ€™s transform component to get him above the ground

* Now Mario is moving but something still feel fishy, it looks like the Input keys were changed! Find the Input Manager tab and fix this (It is located in one of the drop-down menus)

    * Rebind keys correctly in input manager

    * Optional/Recommended: Look into what some of the other Input settings do such as Gravity and Dead

* Something appears to be wrong with the Gravity! (Note this is actual gravity, not Gravity associated with Inputs). Play around with it so that it feels right. It should be under the Physics tab.

### **Art (Artists):**

#### Requirements:

* Replace Mario with a new character! Use any art style you feel comfortable with.

    * Update any other art assets you want (Totally Optional)

* Add art to the new Mario ability that your team creates.

Totally Optional (Extra Credit):

* Write a backstory for your character. If it is a totally different art style try and justify why they are here and why they look so different.

### **Programming (Programmers):**

#### Requirements:

* Pass Little Mario into the Player Controller script using the editor (No coding needed)

    * Note how Little Mario is a public variable in the script

* Make the Mario flip when the direction is changed (`Flip()` function provided)

    * Changes will be made in `FixedUpdate()`

* Make Mario jump

    * Changes will be made to the class Jumping

* Add a new ability to Mario 

    * If your group is not doing the Art category and you have 2 members you must add two new abilities.

    * Ex: Hover jump, double jump, teleportation, etc

    * Does not have to be an actual Mario ability! 

### **Submission:**

* Place a copy of all your art files into a separate folder.

* Make sure you have added us as collaborators

* Add a commit with a final submission tag
